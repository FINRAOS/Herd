/**
 * Configure Log4J based on a possible resource override location, a possible database override location, and a default resource location, in that order. The
 * Log4J configuration itself can include an optional "monitorInterval" attribute that allows the Log4J configuration to be monitored for changes and
 * re-initialized if changes are found.
 * <p/>
 * This class will write to System.out and System.err for output before the logging is successfully initialized. Once the logging is initialized, logging will
 * go to where the logger is configured. Note that it is important to use valid Log4J configuration files for Log4J to work properly. If an invalid
 * configuration file is used, Log4J will output the error to System.err, but will not throw an exception so this class will not know that logging hasn't been
 * configured properly. That means that application logging messages could be lost. If logging was initialized successfully and a new override file is found
 * that is invalid, the previous valid configuration will remain in effect until a new valid configuration is found.
 * <p/>
 * This class contains nested named inner-classes. The reason for this was to keep everything required for the Log4JOverridableConfigurer functionality fully
 * encapsulated within one file so it could be easily ported if needed.
 * <p/>
 * This bean is a bean post processor and is priority ordered. By being a bean post processor, this class will get called early in the bean creation lifecycle:
 * specifically after the beans are instantiated, but before they are used. By being priority ordered (as opposed to standard ordering), our bean will get
 * called before other post processors. This is important to ensure logging is initialized before other things are initialized that could have problems. If
 * other beans have problems and perform error logging (e.g. Hibernate session manager, Ehcache, JGroups), we will loose that logging if we haven't initialized
 * our logging first.
 * <p/>
 * To use a Log4J configuration specified in the database, configure these properties:
 * <pre>
 *     dataSource: the data source for the database to connect to.
 *     tableName: the table name that contains the Log4J configuration.
 *     selectColumn: the column to select that contains the Log4J configuration.
 *     whereColumn and whereValue: an optional column name and value to filter on if multiple rows would be returned where a single row is required.
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * To use an externally specified Log4J override configuration, configure the overrideResourceLocation (e.g. file:///tmp/myOverride.xml).
 * <p/>
 * To use the default Log4J configuration, specify an internally bundled defaultResourceLocation (e.g. classpath:herd-log4j.xml).
 * <p/>
 * Given the difficulty of initializing Log4J from a non-URI such as the database, the approach taken is to read the configuration from the database and copy it
 * to a temporary file on the file system and initializes Log4J from there. Then the database watchdog thread will re-read the configuration as specified in the
 * configuration itself and will update the temporary file. Since the interval for the local file being updated and the interval when Log4J monitors the file
 * for changes are different, the actual changes may be slightly delayed, but no longer than double the configured interval.
